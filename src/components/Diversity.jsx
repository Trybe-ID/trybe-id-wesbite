                        <p>Some of the areas that we are passionate about are growing the number of women developers in the global Blockchain ecosystem and training high-school students with Blockchain fundamentals. Another area of focus for us is with equipping underprivileged kids and adults alike with affordable training accessibility to technologies such as Blockchain.</p>
                        <p>We support these in a variety of ways, including providing deep discounts to training sessions with groups that have women developer participants as well as spending a considerable amount of time with schools globally to empower and prepare our youth for the technology of tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Should your organization or school wish to inquire further about these opportunities, we would love to explore all the ways we can support your initiatives.</p>
